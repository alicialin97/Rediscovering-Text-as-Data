While `NLTK` is still very useful for linguistics analysis and exporation, `spacy` has become a nice option for easy and fast implementation of the NLP pipeline. What's the NLP pipeline? It's a number of common steps computational linguists perform to help them (and the computer) better understand textual data. Digital Humanists are often fond of the pipeline because it gives us more things to count! Let's what `spacy` can give us that we can count."
