    "# Topic Modeling in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lisa Rhody's article, \"Topic Modeling and Figurative Language\", she uses LDA topic modeling to look at ekphrasis poetry. She argues that ekphrasis poetry is particulary well-suited to an LDA analysis because of the assumption of a previously existing set of topics. She's able to extract a number of topics, each constituted of a set of words and probabilities. While we don't have Rhody's corpus, we can use this technique on any large text corpus. We'll use a corpus of novels curated by Andrew Piper.\n",

    "We'll look at an English-language subset of Andrew Piper's novel corpus, totaling 150 novels by British and American authors spanning the years 1771-1930. These texts reside on our volume, each in a separate plaintext file. Metadata is contained in a spreadsheet distributed with the novel files by the [txtLAB](https://txtlab.org/) at McGill.\n",

    "> The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. To the best of my knowledge, it was originally collected by Ken Lang, probably for his Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews paper, though he does not explicitly mention this collection. The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering."
